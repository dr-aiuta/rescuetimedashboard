# Daily Goals Dashboard Implementation

## üéØ Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive daily goals tracking system for your RescueTime dashboard, exactly as requested in your examples. The system provides real-time goal monitoring with visual progress indicators and smart scheduling.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Daily Goals Page** (`/goals`)
- **Real-time tracking** - Updates every 5 minutes automatically
- **Visual progress bars** - Color-coded based on goal type and progress
- **Achievement badges** - Shows achieved, in-progress, and exceeded goals
- **Manual refresh** - Click button to update immediately
- **Responsive design** - Works on all device sizes

### 2. **Sample Goals Matching Your Examples**
Based on your specifications, I've implemented these goals:

‚úÖ **More than 8h per day on All Work** (Mon-Fri All day) - Email, Desktop & Mobile notifications
‚úÖ **More than 3h per day on Cursor** (Work hours) - No notifications  
‚úÖ **Less than 6h per day on all time** (Sat-Sun) - No notifications
‚úÖ **Less than 30m per day on Distracting** (Work hours) - Desktop & Mobile notifications
‚úÖ **Less than 20m per day on Personal** (Work hours) - Desktop & Mobile notifications
‚úÖ **Less than 20m per day on Distracting** (Workday 0-7) - Email, Desktop & Mobile notifications
‚úÖ **Less than 1h per day on Distracting** (24x7) - Desktop & Mobile notifications
‚úÖ **Less than 10h per day on all time** (Mon-Fri All day) - Email, Desktop & Mobile notifications

### 3. **Smart Scheduling System**
Goals only appear when they're supposed to be active:
- **Workday**: Monday-Friday
- **Weekend**: Saturday-Sunday  
- **Work hours**: Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM
- **24x7**: Always active
- **All day**: Always active during scheduled days

### 4. **Progress Calculation**
- **More than goals**: Progress = (actual time / target time) √ó 100%
- **Less than goals**: Progress = (actual time / limit time) √ó 100%
- **Achievement logic**: 
  - "More than" goals are achieved when actual ‚â• target
  - "Less than" goals are achieved when actual ‚â§ limit
  - "Exceeded" status for when limits are surpassed

### 5. **Visual Elements**
- **Progress bars**: Green (good), Yellow (warning), Red (danger)
- **Icons**: ‚ÜóÔ∏è for "more than" goals, ‚ÜôÔ∏è for "less than" goals
- **Status badges**: ‚úì Achieved, ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceeded, In Progress
- **Real-time updates**: Shows last update time
- **Summary dashboard**: Total/Achieved/In Progress/Exceeded counts

## üîó Navigation

Added a "üéØ Daily Goals" button in the main dashboard header that links to `/goals`.

## üìä API Verification

I've also created a comprehensive **API_VERIFICATION.md** document that verifies all RescueTime API endpoints against the official documentation:

### ‚úÖ Currently Used (Working)
- **Analytic Data API** - For productivity and category data
- **Daily Summary Feed API** - For daily time summaries

### üìã Available for Future Enhancement
- **Focus Session APIs** - Start/stop focus sessions programmatically
- **Highlights APIs** - Add daily achievement notes  
- **Alerts APIs** - Get user-defined alerts from RescueTime
- **Offline Time APIs** - Add manual time entries

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Visit** `/goals` from your dashboard
2. **View** all active goals for today based on your schedule
3. **Monitor** real-time progress with visual indicators
4. **Check** achievement status and time remaining
5. **Refresh** manually or wait for automatic updates

## üí° Key Features

- **Schedule-aware**: Only shows relevant goals for current day/time
- **Real-time**: Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded progress and clear status indicators
- **Comprehensive**: Tracks all goal types (time limits, productivity, categories)
- **Responsive**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of API issues

## üîß Technical Implementation

- **TypeScript** - Full type safety for goals system
- **React Hooks** - Efficient state management and auto-refresh
- **SWR Caching** - Smart data fetching and caching
- **Bootstrap UI** - Professional, responsive design
- **Real-time calculations** - Live progress computation from RescueTime data

The goals system integrates seamlessly with your existing RescueTime data and provides the exact functionality you requested with real-time tracking, smart scheduling, and comprehensive progress monitoring.
